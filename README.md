# Welcome to kazoo-gif 🎺🐸

Hey! I'm Alyssa (a.k.a. kazoo-gif) — a CS student, code gremlin, and artist trying to wrangle pixels, logic, and vibes into functional projects. I make stuff that talks to you, reacts to you, or explodes in a satisfying way.

## 💻 Languages & Tools

- 🧠 Functional Languages (Racket, Haskell... maybe)
- ☕ Java & Python
- 🕹️ HTML/CSS/JS for weird lil web things
- 🧩 TyranoBuilder (for VN stuff)

## 🎨 Style & Philosophy

> "Start messy, finish polished."  
> I prototype fast, document along the way, and refactor once I’ve played enough. Clean code is the endgame, not the starting point.

- Embrace edge cases.
- Test like a gremlin with a vendetta.
- If it breaks, it teaches.

✨ Stay curious. Stay chaotic. Ship weird things.
